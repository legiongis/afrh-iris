### Management Activities

Two resource types - Management Activity A and Management Activity B - were designed to track and manage development projects that take place throughout the grounds. This allows for the creation of a "resource" in the database for a development project, like a golf hole relocation. Records of official reviews (ARPA, NEPA, Section 106...), project boundaries, consultations, points of contact, etc. can all be attached to this Management Activity resource. In turn, the Management Activity can be related to any other database resource.
