# Ignored Branches

These branches were created by Farallon during their work on this project. A number of nodes and structures have been changed since then in the actual Resource Models, so while these are retained for posterity, they may not reflect what is in the AFRH-IRIS schema.

They are in this `ignore` directory to keep them from being loaded during a default package load.
